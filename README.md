# Dagger-2-Example-Android-Basic

This is just a very simple example on how one would use Dagger 2 in Android (but without the new fancy @ContributesAndroidInjector).

I mostly use(d) this as a playground to try things out and figure out how Dagger 2 works.

The next step will be to take a look at the actual Android integration with AndroidInjector<T>.
